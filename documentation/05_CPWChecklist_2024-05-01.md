# Checking the Comparative Pathology Workbench #

I recommend testing the resulting system by attempting the following tasks:

-   Can you create an Active Collection?

-   Can you browse the IDR Image Source?

-   Can you add an image from the IDR Image Source to your Active Collection?

-   Can you browse the "Your WordPress" Image Source?

    -   (You will need to add such an image directly to the WordPress system setup here)

-   Can you add an image from the "Your WordPress" Image Source to your Active Collection?

-   Can you upload an Image to the "THIS Comparative Pathology Workbench" Image Source?

-   Can you add an image from the "THIS Comparative Pathology Workbench" Image Source to your Active Collection?

-   Can you upload a Chart to the "EBI Single Cell Atlas" Image Source?

-   Can you add an image from the "EBI Single Cell Atlas" Image Source to your Active Collection?

-   Can you create a Bench?

    -   (This will create a matching Blog Post on the WordPress system)
    
        - browse that!

-   Can you add an Image to a Bench Cell?

    -   (This will create a matching Blog Post on the WordPress system)
